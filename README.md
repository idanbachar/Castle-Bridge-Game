## How to play?

### Teams

The game is divided into two groups - red and yellow.
The goal of each team is to invade the opposing team's palace, steal three diamonds from it and bring them to your palace before the opposing team.

  <th>Red</th>

  </td>
  <td>

  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

### Characters

Each group has three characters:

1. **Archer**
2. **Knight**
3. **Mage**

Each character has unique attacks and a different appearance and a different strategy.
The characters must be used wisely, the strategy is what will determine the end of the battle.
